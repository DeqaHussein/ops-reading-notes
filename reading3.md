# Reading 3 

This topic is very important to familiarize yourself with when you are learning about computers and their functions.
## Questions 

What is the BIOS?
BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System.
Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process.

The best analogy I can think of is using the key to start the engine in a car. When you put the key inside the engine and start the car, the same thing happens when you are booting the computer system. You are reigniting everything and making sure everything is correct.

What is the “Power on Self Test”?
The power-on self-test is basically the BIOS checking if all the computer parts are working correctly.
What is the CMOS?
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
What is the CMOS battery?
It's a little battery that keeps track of important BIOS settings and other important stuff for your computer even when it is off, and it is usually around or near the Cmos inside the motherboard.

## Things I want to know more about
- More about BIOS,CMOS and everything else we learned today.
- I want to learn where i can find the switches.
- I want to learn how to configure a BIOS.
