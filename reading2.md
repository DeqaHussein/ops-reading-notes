I actually need to learn all the parts of a computer and its functions, its the foundation of everything. 

Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? I think it depends on what you would be using it for.
Under which circumstances is that true? For example; a gamer would like a CPU with higher speed, a data analyst would prefer more cores. 
How many CPU cores does a computer need? 
-New stuff has hyper-threading which has the ability to have multiple threads, it has the capability to balance it out. 
What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor? 
-Budget
-Brand & Reliability
If you want to upgrade in the future, how would that affect the motherboard you are getting now.
-How many ports are available on the motherboard? 
-RAM/memory you want on the computer?

What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
-How fast can it go?
-How reliable will it be?
-My budget.
-The battery 
-Will it be for a desktop or computer? 

Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
-Honestly, since I don't know anything, I would probably compare it to building a house.
