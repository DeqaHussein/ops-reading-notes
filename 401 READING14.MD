List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?
Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?
Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?


**Differences between Firewalls and IDS:**

1. **Function and Purpose:**
   - **Firewall:** A firewall acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet). It primarily enforces access control policies, deciding which network traffic is allowed or blocked based on predefined rules.
   - **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** An IDS monitors network or system activities for signs of malicious activities or security policy violations. It doesn't block traffic but instead alerts administrators or takes actions based on detected threats.

2. **Action on Detected Threats:**
   - **Firewall:** Firewalls take preventive measures by blocking or allowing traffic based on predetermined rules. They act proactively to prevent unauthorized access or undesirable network activities.
   - **IDS:** IDS focuses on detection rather than prevention. When suspicious activity is identified, the IDS generates alerts, but it doesn't actively block or allow traffic. The response is typically left to administrators or other security systems.

**Choosing Network-based IDS (NIDS) over Host-based IDS (HIDS):**

Choosing between Network-based IDS (NIDS) and Host-based IDS (HIDS) depends on the security requirements and the nature of the network. Here are circumstances where NIDS might be preferred:

1. **Large Network Environments:**
   - **Scenario:** In large and complex network environments, it might be impractical to deploy HIDS on every individual host.
   - **Reasoning:** NIDS can monitor network traffic at a centralized point, providing a more scalable solution for large networks. It can efficiently analyze traffic for signs of suspicious activities across multiple hosts.

2. **Real-time Network Monitoring:**
   - **Scenario:** If real-time monitoring of network traffic is a priority.
   - **Reasoning:** NIDS can analyze network traffic as it occurs, providing immediate detection and response to potential threats. HIDS, on the other hand, may rely on logs and periodic scans, which may not be as timely for certain types of attacks.

**Drawbacks of Network-based IDS (NIDS):**

1. **Limited Visibility into Host-specific Activities:**
   - **Challenge:** NIDS focuses on network traffic and might not have detailed visibility into individual host-specific activities or events that occur solely within a host's operating system.
   - **Impact:** This limitation can make it challenging to detect certain types of attacks or activities that are confined to a specific host.

2. **Potential for False Positives:**
   - **Challenge:** NIDS can generate false positives, indicating the presence of an attack when none exists. This can occur due to anomalies in network traffic patterns or misconfigurations.
   - **Impact:** Managing false positives can be time-consuming, and excessive false alarms may lead to alert fatigue, where administrators become less responsive to alerts.

3. **Encrypted Traffic Inspection Challenges:**
   - **Challenge:** NIDS may face difficulties in inspecting encrypted traffic, as it cannot easily decipher the contents of encrypted communications.
   - **Impact:** This limitation can result in a blind spot for detecting threats concealed within encrypted communication, making it challenging to identify certain types of malicious activities.
