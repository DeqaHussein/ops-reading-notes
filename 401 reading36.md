Certainly! Let's break down cross-site scripting (XSS) and its various aspects in non-technical terms:

1. **Explanation of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is like leaving a secret message in a public place where anyone passing by can see it. Imagine you have a website where users can leave comments, like a guestbook. Now, if someone sneaky writes a message that includes some code instead of just plain text, and you display that message to everyone who visits your website, you're inadvertently letting that code run on your website.

2. **Types of XSS Attacks**:

There are primarily three types of XSS attacks:

   - **Reflected XSS**: This is like writing a message on a mirror. The attacker crafts a special link or message containing malicious code and sends it to the victim. When the victim clicks on the link or interacts with the message, the code gets executed in the victim's browser.
   
   - **Stored XSS**: In this scenario, it's as if the attacker plants a message with hidden code on a notice board. The malicious script is stored on the server, for example, in a database. Whenever someone views the page containing that stored script, the code runs in their browser.
   
   - **DOM-based XSS**: This one is a bit like leaving a coded message in a book. The attacker manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page directly through client-side scripts. When the victim's browser processes the script, it executes in the context of the victim's session.

3. **Malicious Actions of XSS Exploits**:

If an attacker successfully exploits an XSS vulnerability, they can do various harmful things, such as:

   - Stealing session cookies: This allows them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
   
   - Defacing websites: They could change the appearance of the website or display offensive content.
   
   - Phishing: They might create fake login forms to trick users into entering their credentials, which are then sent to the attacker.
   
   - Browser Redirection: They could redirect users to malicious websites.
   
   - Keylogging: They could capture keystrokes entered by users.
   
   - Exfiltrating sensitive data: They could steal personal information entered on forms.

4. **Security Controls to Prevent XSS Attacks**:

To prevent XSS attacks, there are several security controls that can be implemented:

   - Input validation: Ensure that all user inputs, such as form submissions or URL parameters, are properly validated and sanitized before being displayed or processed.
   
   - Output encoding: Encode special characters before displaying user-generated content to prevent browsers from interpreting them as code.
   
   - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a CSP to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded on your website, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
   
   - HTTPOnly flag for cookies: Set the HTTPOnly flag on cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side scripts, mitigating the risk of session hijacking.
   
   - Regular security updates: Keep software, frameworks, and libraries up to date to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
   
   - Educating developers: Train developers on secure coding practices and the risks associated with XSS vulnerabilities to ensure they write secure code from the outset.
