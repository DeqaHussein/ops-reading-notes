I would explain to them the importance of using SOC2 and what that would mean for how other companies would trust us and do business with us, and most importantly, how that would save us money and make us.

Security
Confidentiality
Privacy
Availability
Processing Integrity


How would you explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
