Sure! As a Malware Analyst, my main responsibility is to analyze and understand malicious software, also known as malware, to uncover its behavior, purpose, and potential impact. Essentially, I dissect malware to figure out how it works and how to defend against it. Here's how I'd explain my job responsibilities to a family member:

1. **Identifying Malicious Code**: I examine suspicious files or programs to determine if they contain malicious code.
2. **Analyzing Behavior**: I observe how the malware behaves when executed, such as what files it accesses, what network connections it makes, or what changes it makes to the system.
3. **Reverse Engineering**: I reverse engineer the malware to understand its inner workings, including its algorithms, encryption methods, and communication protocols.
4. **Extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: I identify IOCs, such as file names, registry keys, IP addresses, or URLs associated with the malware, which can be used to detect and block it.
5. **Creating Signatures and Countermeasures**: Based on my analysis, I develop signatures and countermeasures to detect and mitigate the malware's presence on systems.
6. **Reporting and Documentation**: Finally, I document my findings and prepare reports to inform stakeholders about the malware's characteristics, potential impact, and recommended actions to mitigate risks.

Now, for the mnemonic to remember the six steps of the Malware Analysis process, you could use "IARCEP":
"I Analyze Really Cool Evil Programs."

If I were tasked with analyzing a new malware sample, the type of malware analysis I would conduct first is static analysis. Static analysis involves examining the malware without executing it, focusing on its code structure, file properties, and other attributes. This approach allows me to gain initial insights into the malware's characteristics and behavior without risking the integrity of the system. It's a safe and efficient way to start understanding the malware before moving on to more invasive or dynamic analysis techniques.
