How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?

Give it a public IP address.

What are examples of services that would live in the publicly accessible part of the VPC? The privately accessible part?

Public website, application

Private-internal server databasesâ€”anything you don't want anyone to look at

What are the trade-offs between using a VPC and traditional infrastructure?

traditional: control to hardware, more expensive to set up
