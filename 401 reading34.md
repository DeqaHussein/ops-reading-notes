Computer forensics and cybersecurity are related fields but have distinct focuses and methodologies:

1. **Focus:**
   - **Cybersecurity:** Primarily concerned with protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other security breaches. It involves implementing security measures, monitoring for threats, and responding to incidents.
   - **Computer Forensics:** Involves the identification, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence to investigate and prove cybercrimes or other digital incidents. It focuses on gathering evidence from digital devices to support legal proceedings.

2. **Objectives:**
   - **Cybersecurity:** Aims to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats and attacks to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems.
   - **Computer Forensics:** Aims to collect, preserve, and analyze digital evidence in a forensically sound manner to support investigations and legal proceedings.

3. **Activities:**
   - **Cybersecurity:** Includes tasks such as network monitoring, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, incident response, and implementing security controls like firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption.
   - **Computer Forensics:** Involves activities such as evidence identification, preservation, imaging, analysis, documentation, and reporting. It also includes legal procedures and testifying in court.

4. **Timeframe:**
   - **Cybersecurity:** Often focuses on real-time monitoring and response to immediate threats and incidents.
   - **Computer Forensics:** Involves a more methodical and detailed examination of digital evidence over an extended period, often conducted as part of an investigation or legal proceeding.

The six stages of a computer forensics examination typically include:

1. **Identification:** Determine the scope of the investigation, identify the digital devices involved, and establish the goals and objectives.

2. **Preservation:** Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of digital evidence by securing and preserving the original data through proper handling and documentation.

3. **Collection:** Collect digital evidence using forensically sound techniques, such as making bit-by-bit copies (forensic images) of storage media, to prevent alteration or contamination of the original evidence.

4. **Analysis:** Examine and analyze the collected data to identify relevant information, artifacts, and potential evidence using specialized forensic tools and techniques.

5. **Documentation:** Document the findings, analysis processes, methodologies, and any actions taken during the investigation to maintain a clear and comprehensive record of the forensic examination.

6. **Presentation:** Present the findings and analysis in a clear and understandable manner, often in the form of written reports, expert testimony, or other formats suitable for legal proceedings.
