One of the major advantages of PowerShell Empire is its ability to evade traditional antivirus and endpoint detection mechanisms. PowerShell Empire uses PowerShell, which is a legitimate scripting language built into Windows, making it harder for antivirus programs to detect malicious activity.

Several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups have been known to use PowerShell Empire as part of their attack campaigns. Some of these groups include APT29 (Cozy Bear), APT28 (Fancy Bear), APT33 (Elfin), APT32 (OceanLotus), and APT34 (OilRig). The use of PowerShell Empire typically falls into the "Execution" phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, where attackers execute their malicious code on the target system.

To pull off an attack using PowerShell Empire, four main components are needed:

1. **Listener**: This component listens for incoming connections from compromised systems and allows the attacker to interact with them.

2. **Stager**: The stager is a small piece of code that is initially executed on the target system to establish communication with the attacker's command and control server. It is usually delivered via a phishing email or another initial access vector.

3. **Agent**: Once the stager establishes communication with the attacker's infrastructure, it downloads the agent onto the compromised system. The agent is responsible for executing commands and carrying out the attacker's instructions.

4. **Modules**: PowerShell Empire includes a wide range of modules that provide various functionalities for post-exploitation activities. These modules allow attackers to perform tasks such as lateral movement, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and persistence.
