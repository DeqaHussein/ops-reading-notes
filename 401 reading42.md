Mimikatz is a powerful post-exploitation tool that is commonly used to gather credentials and perform various other malicious activities on compromised systems. It's capable of several credential-gathering techniques:

1. **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**: This technique involves taking a captured hash, typically from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory, and using it to authenticate to other systems on the network. This allows an attacker to bypass the need for plaintext credentials.

2. **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)**: Mimikatz can extract Kerberos tickets from memory, allowing attackers to impersonate users and access network resources without needing the user's password.

3. **Pass-the-Cache (PtC)**: This technique involves extracting cached credentials from memory. Mimikatz can access and retrieve these cached credentials, which may include plaintext passwords or password hashes, stored by various Windows components and applications.

4. **Pass-the-Certificate (PtCrt)**: In Windows, certificates are used for various authentication purposes. Mimikatz can extract certificates from the Windows memory and use them for authentication, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.

5. **Over-Pass-the-Hash (oPtH)**: This technique involves manipulating the LSASS process memory to create new authentication sessions, effectively allowing attackers to generate new hash values for different user accounts.

6. **Pass-the-Key (PtK)**: Mimikatz can extract keys used for the Kerberos authentication protocol, allowing attackers to perform cryptographic attacks or impersonate legitimate users.

Now, for defense against Mimikatz attacks, here are four potential strategies:

1. **Regular Patching and Updates**: Keeping systems up-to-date with the latest security patches can help mitigate vulnerabilities that Mimikatz and other similar tools exploit. For example, Microsoft regularly releases patches to address vulnerabilities in LSASS and other components that Mimikatz targets.

2. **Credential Guard**: Credential Guard is a Windows security feature that helps protect credentials stored in LSASS memory from being accessed by unauthorized processes, including Mimikatz. It achieves this by using virtualization-based security to isolate and protect sensitive information.

3. **Monitoring and Detection**: Implementing robust monitoring and detection mechanisms can help identify unauthorized access attempts and suspicious activities associated with Mimikatz usage. This includes monitoring for unusual process behaviors, network traffic patterns, and unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Least Privilege Principle**: Limiting user privileges and restricting access to sensitive systems and resources can help minimize the impact of Mimikatz attacks. By following the principle of least privilege, organizations can reduce the likelihood of attackers gaining access to valuable credentials and sensitive information.

**Explanation of two mitigations**:

1. **Credential Guard**: By isolating and protecting credentials stored in LSASS memory using virtualization-based security, Credential Guard prevents Mimikatz from accessing and extracting sensitive information, such as password hashes and Kerberos tickets. This effectively mitigates Pass-the-Hash (PtH), Pass-the-Ticket (PtT), and other credential-gathering techniques that rely on accessing credentials from LSASS memory.

2. **Regular Patching and Updates**: Patching vulnerabilities in Windows components, such as LSASS, can prevent Mimikatz from exploiting known weaknesses to access sensitive information. For example, if Microsoft releases a patch to address a memory corruption vulnerability in LSASS, applying the patch can prevent Mimikatz from successfully extracting credentials from the affected system's memory.
