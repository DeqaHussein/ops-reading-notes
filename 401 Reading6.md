To preserve the three elements of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) for the company's file server, you would implement access controls and encryption to ensure confidentiality, regularly check and validate data integrity through methods like hashing, and implement backup and redundancy measures to maintain availability.

Hashing verifies data integrity by creating a unique "digital fingerprint" or hash value for a set of data. If the data is altered in any way, even a tiny change, the hash value will be significantly different, allowing easy detection of tampering without revealing the actual content.

Hashing and encryption serve different purposes. Hashing is a one-way process used to verify data integrity, while encryption is a two-way process that transforms data to make it unreadable without the proper decryption key, ensuring confidentiality.
