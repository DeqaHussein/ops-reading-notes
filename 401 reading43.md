Imagine you're sending a secret message to a friend, but there's someone sneaky lurking around, trying to listen in on your conversation. In the world of computers, this sneaky behavior is called a sniffing attack.

In a sniffing attack, the sneaky person uses special tools to intercept and eavesdrop on the data traveling across a network. It's like they're listening in on the conversation between your computer and the server it's talking to.

There are two main types of sniffing attacks:

1. **Passive Sniffing**: This is like someone quietly listening in without actively participating in the conversation. They're just grabbing the data passing by. The advantage of passive sniffing is that it's less likely to be detected since it doesn't interact with the network actively. However, it may not capture all data if encryption is used.

2. **Active Sniffing**: Here, the sneaky person gets more involved. They might inject themselves into the conversation, pretending to be part of it, all the while gathering information. Active sniffing can capture more data because it's actively participating in the network traffic. However, it's riskier as it's more likely to be detected.

Encryption acts as a protective shield against sniffing attacks. It's like encoding your message in a secret language that only you and your friend understand. When data is encrypted, even if the sneaky person manages to intercept it, they can't make sense of it without the decryption key. So, encryption scrambles the data, making it useless to anyone trying to sniff it out without permission.
