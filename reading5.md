## Reading Notes 

## Questions 

Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?

Shell: The shell is basically a middleman between a human and an operating system. The user makes the command, the shell interprets it, and then it makes it happen.
Terminal: The terminal is the communication system that humans use in order to make commands.
Cli: The terminal talks to the shell using the CLI interface.
Command Prompt: This is only on the Windows OS. When you type a command here, it communicates with the operating system.

It's better because you can make a script that makes it easier to automate tasks; it's easier to not make mistakes when everything is done using a script; and you can also remote into the computers using the terminal. Back when I used to work as a desktop tech, our engineers would write scripts, and that would make it easier for us to image, update bios, and make software updates on a lot of computers at the same time, for example.

What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents, and rename or remove files?

Change Directories - The article states the following. "You can change the working directory using the cd command, an abbreviation for ‘change directory’." CD/"

List the file contents: https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmagic/command-prompt-list-files.html
This is a good article that teaches how to list files.
Rename or move files: The article states the following: "The syntax of the CMD rename file is “rename/ren [<drive>:] [<path>]<filename1> <filename2>”.

Drive: It refers to the drive letter that contains the file or set of files you want to rename.
Path: It specifies the directory that the folder/subfolders located on the drive."

What are relative and absolute paths?

The article states this.
https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#3-opening-a-terminal

"Most of the examples we’ve looked at so far use relative paths. That is, the place you end up depends on your current working directory. Consider trying to cd into the “etc” folder. If you’re already in the root directory, that will work fine."

"But we have seen two commands that are absolute. No matter what your current working directory is, it’ll have the same effect. The first is when you run CD on its own to go straight to your home directory. The second is when you used cd / to switch to the root directory. In fact, any path that starts with a forward slash is an absolute path."

What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?

The article states this. "There’s one other handy shortcut that works as an absolute path. As you’ve seen, using “/” at the start of your path means “starting from the root directory”. Using the tilde character (”~”) at the start of your path similarly means “starting from my home directory”. "
