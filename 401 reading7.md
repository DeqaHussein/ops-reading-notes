From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.

Rest - Data on a hard drive 
Transit - Email being sent 

Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.

1. **Confidentiality:** Encryption helps to keep data confidential by scrambling it into a format that is unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. This ensures that even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the data, they cannot understand or use it.
2. **Integrity:** Encryption also helps maintain the integrity of data by ensuring that it has not been altered during transit or storage. Any unauthorized modification to encrypted data would render it unreadable or invalid.
3. **Availability:** While encryption primarily focuses on confidentiality and integrity, it indirectly contributes to availability by preventing unauthorized access and tampering. This helps in ensuring that data remains accessible to authorized users when needed.
In summary, data encryption is a fundamental component in safeguarding data both at rest and in transit, addressing the key concerns of the CIA triad and enhancing overall data security.
