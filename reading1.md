# Deqa's OPS Reading

## Ops Readings

### Reading #1
I think this topic is important because it will teach us the many ways on how cyberattacks work and how they were resolved in the past and the impact they have on us today. 
How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
  For a hardware attack to happen it would require that the person was there or hid a chip or something into whatever it was they were making. Software attacks usually happen when someone is using some sort of application or script to hack. 
What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware? The answer came from the article, link is below. "There are two ways for spies to alter the guts of computer equipment. One, known as interdiction, consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer. This approach is favored by U.S. spy agencies, according to documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The other method involves seeding changes from the very beginning."
Explain how the hack worked. It was a microchip planted into the motherboard that was not apart of the original plan.

How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? The answer came from the article, link is below."During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China."

## Things I want to know more about. 
I would like to learn more about the security of supply chain.
How often does this type of attack hapen?
