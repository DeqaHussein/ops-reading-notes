## Reading notes 


What is the main purpose of implementing NAT on a network?

Its job is to give IP addresses to all devices.

At what layer of the OSI model does NAT happen?

It makes sure that data gets sent to the devices through the interface correctly.

What happens to packets when NAT runs out of addresses? It will just reuse the same IP address.


What disadvantage does using NAT pose for routers?

The frequent address changes make it harder for routers to keep up.
