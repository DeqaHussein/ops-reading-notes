## Questions & Answers 


What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?

Honestly, I would solve the most pressing and impactful issue first. I learned yesterday that I would have to document everything and make sure I had solved the problem by going back and trying it myself.

What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?

I would write down what I did and how or why it worked. I would do it again and learn from it.

What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

 

Think about a technological device that is particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply the CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help while considering the end-user’s cultural background?
